# Will you be my Easter egg?

Easter themed spin on the traditional Valentine's Day question.

(The idea of the application itself is not originally mine,
I've seen it around the internet :D)

A quick little HTML/CSS snippet to create this silly app. Basically it rotates five different sad egg images when user clicks 'no' and the 'yes' button increases in size. When user clicks 'yes' a happy egg appears.
